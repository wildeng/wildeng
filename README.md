### Ay-Up!

I'm Alain and I like playing with computers, therefore, when not occupied with something else, I code.

You can find me on the Internet in different places:

* my [personal place](https://alainmauri.eu)
* [DEV](https://dev.to/wildeng)
* On Twitter [@wildeng](https://twitter.com/wildeng)
* On [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alainmauri/)

I have  many ideas and I'm currently looking for new opportunities!

Cheers!
